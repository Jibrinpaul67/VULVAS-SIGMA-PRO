    Information VULAS collects and controls
  </h2>
  <p className="text-xl text-gray-600 mb-10">
    We only collect the information that we actually need. Some of that is information that you actively give us
    when you sign up for an account, ask for customer support, or buy a product.
    We store your name and contact information, but we do not store credit card numbers (except with your
    permission and in one of our secured payment gateways).
    When you visit our websites or use our software, we automatically log some basic information like how
    you got to the site, where you navigated within it, and what features and settings you use. We use this
    information to improve our websites and services and to drive new product development.
    Sometimes we receive information indirectly. If you ask about our products through one of our referral
    programs or reselling partners, or sign in to one of our products through an authentication service provider
    like LinkedIn or Google, they pass on your contact information to us. We use that information to
    complete the request that you made. If you engage with our brand on social media (for instance, liking,
    commenting, retweeting, mentioning, or following us), we will have access to your interactions and profile
    information. We will still have that information even if you later remove it from the social media site.

  <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-black mb-4">
    What we do with your information
  </h2>
  <p className="text-xl text-gray-600 mb-10">
    We use your information to provide the services you have requested, create and maintain your accounts, and keep
    an eye out for unauthorized activity on your accounts. We also use it to communicate with you about the
    products you are currently using, your customer support requests, new products you may like, chances for you to
    give us feedback, and policy updates. We analyze the information we collect to understand user needs and to
    improve our website and services.
    We are required to have a legal basis for collecting and processing your information. In most cases, we either
    have your consent or need the information to provide the service you have requested from us. When that is not
    the case, we must demonstrate that we have another legal basis, such as our legitimate business interests.
    You can decline certain kinds of information used either by not providing the information in the first place or
    by opting out later. You can also disable cookies to prevent your browser from giving us information, but if
    you do so, certain website features may not work properly. We completely disable non-essential and intrusive
    third-party cookies from all our websites and products.
    We limit access to your personal information to our employees and contractors who have a legitimate need to
    use it. If we share your information with other parties (like developers, service providers, domain
    registrars, and reselling partners), they must have appropriate security measures and a valid reason for
    using your information, typically to serve you.
    We keep your personal information for as long as it is required for the purposes stated in this Privacy
    Policy. When we no longer have a legitimate need to process your information, we will delete, anonymize,
    or isolate your information, whichever is appropriate.

  <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-black mb-4">
    Retention Information
  </h2>
  <p className="text-xl text-gray-600 mb-10">
    We retain your personal information for as long as it is required for the purposes stated in
    this Privacy Policy. Sometimes, we may retain your information for longer periods as permitted
    or required by law, such as to maintain suppression lists, prevent abuse, if required in connection
    with a legal claim or proceeding, to enforce our agreements, for tax, accounting, or to comply with
    other legal obligations. When we no longer have a legitimate need to process your information, we
    will delete or anonymize your information from our active databases. We will also securely store the
    information and isolate it from further processing on backup discs until deletion is possible.

<h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-black mb-4">

  <li><strong>Right to erasure:</strong> You have the right to request that we delete your personal information in certain circumstances, such as when it is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was originally collected.</li>
  <li><strong>Right to restriction of processing:</strong> You may also have the right to request to restrict the use of your information in certain circumstances, such as when you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
  <li><strong>Right to data portability:</strong> You have the right to transfer your information to a third party in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, in circumstances where the information is processed with your consent or by automated means.</li>
  <li><strong>Right to object:</strong> You have the right to object to the use of your information in certain circumstances, such as the use of your personal information for direct marketing.</li>
  <li><strong>Right to complain:</strong> You have the right to complain to the appropriate supervisory authority if you have any grievance against the way we collect, use or share your information. This right may not be available to you if there is no supervisory authority dealing with data protection in your country.</li>

{/* Section 5 */}
<h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-black mb-4">Business Transfers</h2>
<p className="text-xl text-gray-600 mb-10">
  We do not plan to sell our business, but if it ever happens through sale, acquisition, or merger, we will make sure the new owner is 
  legally bound to honor our privacy commitments. You will be notified via email or a prominent notice on our site about any ownership 
  changes, updates to how your personal information is used, and any choices you have regarding it.

{/* Section 6 */}
<h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-black mb-4">Compliance with this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p className="text-xl text-gray-600 mb-10">
  We regularly review our processes to ensure your personal information is handled in line with this policy. If you have concerns about our
   privacy practices, email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@vulas.com" className="text-blue-600">privacy@vulas.com</a>. We will respond

{/* Section 7 */}
<h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-black mb-4">Notification of Changes</h2>
<p className="text-xl text-gray-600 mb-10">
  We may update this policy and will notify you via service announcements or email. Significant changes affecting your 
  rights will come with at least 30 days notice to your primary email. If your email is not verified, you might miss these notices. 
  If you disagree with changes, you can stop using our services within 30 days. Continued use after changes take effect means you accept 
  the new policy. Minor changes would not be emailed, so check <a href="https://www.vulas.com/privacy" className="text-blue-600">
