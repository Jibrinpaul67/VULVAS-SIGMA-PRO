   Description of the Service
  </h2>
  <p className="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
   VULAS Security provides an AI-powered cybersecurity solution designed to protect networking devices, servers,
    personal computers, and IT assets from evolving cyber threats. Using a secure probe server model, lightweight 
    probes are installed within your network or endpoints to continuously monitor, discover, and report on
     vulnerabilities. These probes send encrypted data to the VULAS Central Server, where AI-driven analysis detects 
     intrusions, suspicious traffic, ransomware attempts, and other malicious activities. Users can access insights, 
     alerts, and reports from any standard web browser through an intuitive dashboard, enabling real-time monitoring 
     and proactive security management.  </p><p className="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-600 mb-10">
VULAS combines multiple layers of protection including Wi-Fi security, ransomware defense, and endpoint monitoring; to
 safeguard both personal and enterprise environments. The service is available through a free trial with 
 subscription-based plans for continued use, and subscriptions renew automatically unless canceled in advance.
  All communication between probes and the central server uses secure HTTPS connections, and while VULAS helps 
  minimize risk, you are responsible for maintaining Internet connectivity and compatible equipment.
  </p>

  {/* Section 3 */}
  <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-black mb-4">Free Trial</h2>
<p className="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">

  available to you on a trial basis free of charge until the earliest of:
</p>
<ul className="list-disc list-inside text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
  <li>The end of the free trial period for the applicable Services (unless terminated earlier by you)</li>
  <li>The start date of your paid subscription for the applicable Services</li>
  <li>Termination by VULAS at its sole discretion</li>
</ul>
<p className="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
  Any data you enter into the Services, along with any configurations or customizations made during the trial,

 Inactive User Account Policy
</h2>
<p className="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
We reserve the right to terminate unpaid user accounts that are inactive for a continuous period of 120 days. In the event of such termination,
 all data associated with such user account will be deleted. We will provide you prior notice of such termination and backup of your data by 
 email. The data deletion policy may be implemented with respect to any or all of the Services. Each Service will be considered an independent 
 and separate service for the purpose of calculating the period of inactivity. In other words, activity in one of the Services is not
  sufficient to keep your user account in another Service active. In case of accounts with more than one user, if at least one of the users
   is active, the account will not be considered inactive.
</p>

{/* Section 5 */}
<h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-black mb-4">Fees and Payments</h2>
<p className="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
  Paid Subscriptions are available under subscription plans of various durations. Your subscription will be automatically renewed at the end 
  of each subscription period unless you inform us that you do not wish to renew the subscription.
</p>
<p className="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
  At the time of automatic renewal, the subscription fee will be charged to the Credit Card last used by you. If you would like the payment 
  for the renewal to be made through a different Credit Card or if you do not wish to renew the subscription, you agree to inform us at least 
  seven days prior to the renewal date. If you do not inform us, you will be presumed to have authorized VULAS to charge the subscription fee 
  to the Credit Card last used by you.
</p>
<p className="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
  You will not have the option of requesting refund of any payment made by you. VULAS reserves the right to change the subscription fee and to 
  charge for use of Services that are currently available free of charge. You will not be charged for using any Service unless you have opted 
  for a paid subscription plan. Information on the subscription options and charges for paid Services will be made available in the applicable 
  pricing page of the Services.
</p>
<p className="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
  In the event any tax such as GST, VAT, sales tax or the like is chargeable by VULAS in accordance with any local, state, provincial 
  or foreign laws with respect to your subscription to our Services (Taxes), VULAS will invoice you for such Taxes. You agree to pay VULAS
  such Taxes in addition to the subscription fees. VULAS shall provide you with an invoice in the format prescribed by the applicable local, 
  state, provincial or foreign laws to help you avail the applicable input tax credit for the Taxes so paid.
